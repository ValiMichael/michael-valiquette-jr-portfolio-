# Michael Valiquette Jr. — Product Design Engineer Portfolio

Welcome! This is the source for my professional portfolio website, designed to showcase my experience, patents, and award-winning work in product design engineering. Built for clarity, impact, and easy navigation, this site is ideal for employers and collaborators seeking a proven innovator.

## 🌟 Why This Portfolio Stands Out

- 20 years of hands-on product design and manufacturing expertise
- 2 granted patents (including a revolutionary vacuum brew apparatus)
- Award-winning technical achievements and cost-saving solutions
- Deep CAD, 3D printing, and process optimization skills
- Modern, responsive, and visually compelling design

## 🚀 Live Demo

## 🎨 Key Features
